# Hand-Gesture-Zoom-code

🖐️ Hand Tracking & Gesture-Based Image Scaling using OpenCV
🚀 Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition using Python, OpenCV, and cvzone to dynamically resize an image based on hand movements! This project detects both hands, identifies specific gestures, and scales an image interactively.

📌 Features:
✔️ Real-time hand detection using OpenCV & cvzone
✔️ Finger tracking for gesture-based interaction
✔️ Two-hand detection for accurate scaling
✔️ Dynamic image resizing using hand distance
✔️ Interactive and responsive visual output
